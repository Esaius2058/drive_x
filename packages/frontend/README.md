# 📁 Drive X — Client

**Drive X Frontend** is the client-side interface of a full-stack Google Drive clone, built with the PERN stack. This frontend interacts with a Supabase-powered backend to let users upload, manage, and store files securely in the cloud.

## Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript

- Vite for blazing-fast dev builds

- Tailwind CSS for styling

- React Router for navigation

- Supabase JS for auth and storage

## Setup

```bash
# Navigate to client directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```
